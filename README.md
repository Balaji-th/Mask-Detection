# Mask-Detection
This Face mask detection technology to monitor people wearing masks in public places during COVID.
I am going to use YOLOv5s, one of the recently used versions of the YOLO family, which comprises the 
state-of-the-art object detection system for the real-time scenario and it is amazingly accurate and fast.
Newer versions such as YOLO-X, YOLO-R might achieve even better results, and in my next articles, I am going to
also experiment with these architectures.
